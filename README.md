# M.U.R.A.L
M.U.R.A.L stands for Machine-aided Understanding and Recognition of Artistic Legacies. It is an application made by me to identify if a piece of art is made by human artist or by a generative AI algorithm.This helps the artist gain the credit they deserve for their hard work and helps to keep the "Human Essence of Art" Intact in the era of AI.
